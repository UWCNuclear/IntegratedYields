# Perl script to extract cross sections for each experiment

Use it as:

    ./integratedyields.pl gosiaoutputfile.out

It will write a dat file called: gosiaoutputfile.out.dat

with a list of Coulex cross sections per experiment that you can later paste into an Excel file and compare with the intensity ratio.
